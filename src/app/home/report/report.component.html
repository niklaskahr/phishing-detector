            <p>
                After dropping your files, the app analyzes common email components and proceeds to assess them. During
                this process, it:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>compares the email content against up-to-date blacklists,</li>
                <li>identifies common phishing keywords and phrases,</li>
                <li>detects code that could execute (potentially dangerous) commands,</li>
                <li>and checks the email's file size and any attached files.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Finally, it provides a conclusion regarding the email's trustworthiness based on these factors. Please
                note that this app can only process emails written in English.
